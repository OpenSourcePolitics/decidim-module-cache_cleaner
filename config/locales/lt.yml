            description: Rails caching is a technique used to speed up web applications by storing frequently accessed data or computations in memory, rather than recomputing them every time they are needed. This can be especially helpful for reducing the amount of time it takes to load pages and improving overall website performance. When your application displays informations that seems out of date, you may try to clear the cache but be carreful, your application will be a little slower while it regenerates.
